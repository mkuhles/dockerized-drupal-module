# Drupal Module Template with local dev setup based on docker

This Project sets up an docker environment for module development.

Before you start change `MODULES_NAME` in `.env`.
Afterwards run `./startover.sh` from within `scripts/` folder.

While setup you'll be asked the drush setup questions, besides the module name.
